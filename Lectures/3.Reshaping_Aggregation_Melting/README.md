 ### Melting 
 
 Melting is the process of going from wide format data to long format data. Often we will be motivated to do this when multiple variables (columns) have values that have a similar kind of meaning. In the case of the flight data, the delay columns all represent different kinds of delays. If we want to compute a number across all delay times we will be motivated to melt the data first.
