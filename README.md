## Communication
### Piazza

We will be using Piazza for class-related discussion and questions, to help you benefit from each other’s questions and the collective knowledge of your classmates and professor. Questions can be posted to the entire class (for content-related questions). I encourage you to ask questions if you are struggling to understand a concept, and to answer your classmates’ questions when you can. Note that you may choose to post questions or comments to Piazza anonymously if you wish. Piazza may also be used for course announcements.

Do Not use Piazza for issues related to your grade or other private matters (not even an instructor post); email those questions or comments to the instructor directly or discuss them in person.

### Email

Most issues about classroom activities can be posted to Piazza, but you should use email (or a conversation in person) for all personal or private matters.

### Grading
Learning outcomes will be assessed based on performance in each of the following categories accompanied by their impact on the overall grade:

* 40% Weekly Activities (in-class and HW)
* 40% Exams (Midterm + Final, 20% each)
* 20% Weekly Quizzes



### Weekly Activities

Weekly assignments may include an activity assigned and completed in part or whole during class. The format and length of in-class assignments will vary as warranted by the subject matter each week, although each assignments will be given the same weight toward the overall grade. There are no make-up assignments.

### Reading Quizzes

Reading quizzes will be due before class in order to assess comprehension of the reading assignment that will be discussed each week. This allows students to see new content and concepts for the first time at their own pace in order to more effectively use class time to emphasize main points, clear up confusion, etc. The goal of the reading quiz is to hold students accountable for completing the reading each week before class.


## Course Description and Objectives
### Description

The official course description is available in Penn State’s University Bulletin [linked here](http://undergraduate.bulletins.psu.edu/search/?scontext=courses&search=stat+184), but a recent version is reproduced below for your convenience.

STAT 184 Introduction to R: R is a powerful, open-source programming language used widely for statistical analyses. It is easily extendible, and thousands of user-created packages are publicly available to extend its capabilities. This course will introduce R syntax: Students will be asked to utilize various descriptive and graphical statistical techniques for various types of datasets. These datasets will primarily be drawn from those that are readily available for R. Furthermore, this course focus on descriptive statistics and graphical summary techniques rather than inferential statistical techniques. In particular, no statistical background will be assumed. In addition to being asked to write well-documented code for functions in R, students will be exposed to development environments (e.g., the open-source RStudio environment).

### Goals and objectives

Some goals and objectives may be reduced or expanded as time permits, but a tentative list follows:

#### General Tools
* Become familiar with R programming language
* Become familiar with RStudio development environment
* Generate reproducible work 
* Navigate some basic syntax and idioms in R
#### Programming style
* Naming variables
* Using functions
* Installing and using contributed packages
#### Read & write data files using R
#### Data wrangling using R
* “Tidy Data”
* data.table and dplyr package
#### Generate descriptive statistics using R
#### Graphs & Data Visualization
* ggplot2 graphics

## Policies & Resources
### Working collaboratively
All quizes and tests must be done individualy without the aid of other students, however many assighnments and in-class activities will be done in groups. Whenever solutions or code is developed in teams the names of all authors should appear on the author line, even when code is submitted individualy. In these cases the principle authors name should appear first followed by all collaborating team members. For this reason, a single persons name may appear on multiple assignments. Turning in an assighnment with an author line that does not reflect the origins of the work is a violation of academic integrity. 

### ECoS Code of Mutual Respect
The Eberly College of Science [Code of Mutual Respect and Cooperation](http://science.psu.edu/climate/support-and-resources/code-of-mutual-respect-and-cooperation-pdf) embodies the values that we hope our faculty, staff, and students possess and will endorse to make the Eberly College of Science a place where every individual feels respected and valued, as well as challenged and rewarded.

### Academic Integrity Statement
Academic dishonesty is not limited to simply cheating on an exam or assignment. The following is quoted directly from the “PSU Faculty Senate Policies for Students” regarding academic integrity and academic dishonesty:

Academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity free from fraud and deception and is an educational objective of this institution. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, cheating, plagiarizing, fabricating of information or citations, facilitating acts of academic dishonesty by others, having unauthorized possession of examinations, submitting work of another person or work previously used without informing the instructor, or tampering with the academic work of other students.
All University and Eberly College of Science policies regarding academic integrity/academic dishonesty apply to this course and the students enrolled in this course. Refer to the following URL for further details on the academic integrity policies of the Eberly College of Science: http://www.science.psu.edu/academic/Integrity/index.html. Each student in this course is expected to work entirely on her/his own while taking any exam, to complete assignments on her/his own effort without the assistance of others unless directed otherwise by the instructor, and to abide by University and Eberly College of Science policies about academic integrity and academic dishonesty. Academic dishonesty can result in assignment of “F” by the course instructors or “XF” by Judicial Affairs as the final grade for the student.

### Disability Policy
Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University’s educational programs. If you have a disability-related need for reasonable academic adjustments in this course, contact Student Disability Resources (SDR; formerly ODS) at 814-863-1807, 116 Boucke, http://equity.psu.edu/student-disability-resources. In order to receive consideration for course accommodations, you must contact ODS and provide documentation (see the guidelines at http://equity.psu.edu/student-disability-resources/guidelines).
